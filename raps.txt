It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
$now Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave
I'm matter, but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain splattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve, gonna have to paint it all
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
Always boasting my emotions on how I'm so fucking broken
Think I'm joking when I'm talkin' about blowing my head open
'Till the moment you walk in and find my body motionless
Wrists slit
Thoughts of $licky falling in an open pit, shit
Always burn my bridges 'cause I'd rather fall in ditches
If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest
And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitchin'
Lane switchin', same mission, to die and blame my addiction, bitch
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

Lil' Bo Peep with a brand new bitch

Friends switch up when you in a Benz truck (skrrt)
Always wanna fuck, tell a bitch, "Good luck"
Always wanna fuck 'cause I just came up, yeah

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Ahem excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, we're a fuckin' family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running shit and you niggas just runner-ups

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man, I be seeing through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talking to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these mu'fuckers talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, guess I'm Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, gonna need a little luck
Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad

Mack I'm goin' in

I'm a Young Money Millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Threw the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that cha cha cha cha chopper
Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father motherfuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, ha ha ha ha you can't catch' em, you can't stop 'em

If you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Then to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe look like it's poutin'

They don't feel me but they fear me I'm illi
C3, 3-peat

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I take that one all the way up
I'm about to take off on these niggas
And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I've seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing with your dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait 'til they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm a show him first
Say we just distinguished beings, baby, me and you diverse
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)
(And I'm codeine dreaming)
'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons be on like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the Moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart
Got the codeine, all my brothers smell like caviar
Codeine dreaming, they come true too
That's my space ship brp brp!
My milky way got pregnant
She said it's for you hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new
I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, two new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi!
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm on metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie you a moron
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and to your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland; I'm Infinite
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral
Is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
Cause there's a monster real in me
That always wants to kill emcees
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool
Then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit; I'm Infinite
